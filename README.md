# ♟️ Chess FreeBuff

> A fully-featured, rules-compliant Chess game built with **Unity** — no external assets, no dependencies. Just pure C# logic and Unity's built-in UI system.

## 🎯 Overview

**Chess FreeBuff** is a clean, self-contained Unity chess implementation focused on correctness and readability. It features a fully rule-compliant chess engine written from scratch in C#, rendered entirely through Unity's runtime UI — no sprite assets, no third-party packages, no setup hassle.

The project is ideal as a foundation for game AI experiments, educational tools, or as a reference implementation for chess logic in Unity.

## 🤖 Built with Vibe Coding

> *"Don't write code. Describe what you want, and let the AI do the rest."*

This entire project was built using **vibe coding** — a development approach where the programmer describes intent in natural language and an AI assistant generates the implementation. No line of code in this repository was typed manually in the traditional sense.

The AI tool used throughout this project is **[Freebuff](https://freebuff.dev)** — an AI-powered coding assistant that turns ideas into working code through conversational prompting.

### What vibe coding looks like in practice:

| Traditional Coding | Vibe Coding with Freebuff |
|---|---|
| Write logic line by line | Describe the feature in plain language |
| Debug syntax errors manually | AI generates syntactically correct code |
| Lookup API docs constantly | AI knows the APIs |
| Hours per feature | Minutes per feature |

This repo is a **proof of concept** that a fully functional, rules-compliant chess game — including edge cases like en passant, castling, and draw by insufficient material — can be built entirely through **AI-assisted vibe coding**.

## ✨ Features

### 🧠 Chess Engine (`ChessEngine.cs`)
- **Complete move legality validation** — pseudo-legal move generation filtered by check detection
- **All standard rules implemented:**
  - Castling (king-side and queen-side) with full rights tracking
  - En passant capture
  - Pawn promotion (auto-promotes to Queen)
  - Check and checkmate detection
  - Stalemate detection
  - Draw by insufficient material (K vs K, K+N/B vs K, K+B vs K+B)
- **Move simulation** — board cloning for safe check-detection without permanent state mutation
- **Fast king position tracking** — O(1) king lookup for check queries

### 🖥️ Game Manager & UI (`GameManager.cs`)
- **Fully procedural UI** — all board squares, overlays, and panels are generated at runtime via code (no prefabs needed)
- **Interactive board:**
  - Click to select and move pieces
  - Legal move highlighting (green = empty square, red = capturable piece)
  - Last move highlight
  - King-in-check highlight (red overlay)
  - Captured pieces display for both sides
- **Keyboard shortcuts:**
  - `R` — Restart game
  - `U` — Undo last move
- **Game over detection** with modal panel (Checkmate / Stalemate / Draw)
- Targets **60 FPS** via `Application.targetFrameRate`

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Unity 2022.x or later** (LTS recommended)
- Unity **Input System** package (included via `Packages/`)

### Running the Project
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fathahnoor/chess-freebuff.git
```
2. Open the project in **Unity Hub**.
3. Open the scene in `Assets/Scenes/`.
4. Press **Play** — the board is generated procedurally at runtime.

## 🎮 How to Play

| Action | Control |
|---|---|
| Select piece | Left-click on your piece |
| Move piece | Left-click on a highlighted square |
| Deselect | Left-click on the same piece again |
| Restart game | Press `R` or click **New Game** |
| Undo move | Press `U` |

## 🏗️ Architecture Notes

The codebase follows a clean separation of concerns:

- **`ChessEngine`** is a pure C# class with **no Unity dependencies** — it can be unit tested independently or ported to any C# environment.
- **`GameManager`** is the Unity-side bridge, responsible solely for rendering state and forwarding player input to the engine.
- **`Piece`** is a lightweight `struct` holding type, color, move history flag, and Unicode symbol mapping.

This architecture makes it straightforward to extend the engine with:
- An AI opponent (Minimax / Alpha-Beta pruning)
- Network multiplayer
- Move history / PGN export
- Custom rule variants

---

## 🔮 Potential Extensions

- [ ] AI opponent with Minimax + Alpha-Beta pruning
- [ ] Pawn promotion UI (choose piece type)
- [ ] Move history panel with algebraic notation (PGN)
- [ ] 50-move rule and threefold repetition draw conditions
- [ ] Multiplayer over network (Netcode for GameObjects / Mirror)
- [ ] Sound effects and animations
- [ ] AR/XR mode (spatial chess board)
